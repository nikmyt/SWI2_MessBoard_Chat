# MessBoard (with chat!)
This is a semestral project called MessBoard. It has register/login user functionality, and the ability for users to make posts and comment on them, as well as filtering of posts and searching for posts.
## Architecture
We use Vue.js and Java Springboot.
## Setup
You will need to install MariaDB, XAMPP and IntelliJ Idea/other Java development environment and set it up correctly. Any dependencies should install automatically. To run the website on your local machine:
1) Start XAMPP and run Apache and MySQL.
2) Start the Java backend. You should see Tomcat server add itself in XAMPP.
3) "npm run dev" the Vue frontend.
4) Go to the provided localhost port and enjoy our website.
## Notes
-you must update your intellij idea (if you're using that IDE) <br>
-you must set the mariadb/mysql port to 3307<br>
-you must set the password of phpmyadmin to ''<br>
-you must uninstall any additional mySQL instances <br>
-you must create a new "messboard" db in phpmyadmin <br>
-for frontend, you must install the newest recommended version of node.js <br>
